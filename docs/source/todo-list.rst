TODO List
=========

* Simulate transmission/reception of data using BPSK with channel model and estimation
        
        * Thus developing an way to synchronize the receptor with transmitter besides filtering noise

* Develop some form of encoding/decoding data to recover text, since the receptor doesn't know where the data begins

.. note::

        It is desirable to learn how to make out-of-tree modules in gnuradio, to sucessfully implement blocks with custom behaviour.
