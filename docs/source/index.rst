Welcome to hobbyist projects documentation!
===========================================

This serves as a place to store all the documentation for several projects created by me, Guilherme, and Helder. We both studied Electrical Engineering in Brazil, at UFPR. At the end of 2020 we decided to work together from distance (me in the Netherlands during my PhD and him in Brazil doing his Masters). The idea was to be able to work together with the strengths of both of us and the equipment each one had access. The main projects are displayed here below, by accessing them you'll be able to see the division proposed and hopefully our initial idea, the challenges and adaptations we made and finally the final product. You can check `Guilherme's github <https://github.com/guilhermetheis>`_ and `Helder's github <https://github.com/helder-sales>`_. Guilherme works with RF (PCB, IC and antenna) while Helder has more experience with digital electronics, control systems and analog/digital PCB design.
